About hecdss
===
This library contains bindings to [HEC-DSS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-dssvue/) in Rust. The included sys crate "hecdss-sys" automatically generates low-level C interface to Rust (FFI). The FFI is then used to create safe Rust APIs to HEC-DSS. This library is a work in progress. There is also a Python binding [pydsstools](https://github.com/gyanz/pydsstools) for HEC-DSS.
